            <p>
                I've completed my BBA MBA in Marketing from Jagannath University. But I feel interest in coding and design. So, finally I've decided to make me a dedicated learner of the web development.I want to be a Full Stack web developer and working hard to make my dream true. This is my first website as a deveopler portfolio. I am very much excited to make this design by coding. </p>

            <p> Special thanks goes to <span class="tutor">Jhankar Mahbub</span> vai. Due to his easy, attractiive learnign style I can make this website.
